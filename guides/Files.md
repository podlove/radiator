## Audio Files

The `Radiator.Media.AudioFile` schema represents a single audio file. It is attached to either an episode or network via `Radiator.Media.Attachment`.

    +---------+       +---------+
    | Episode |       | Network |
    +----+----+       +----+----+
         | +------------+  |
         +-> Attachment +<-+
           +------+-----+
                  |
                  v
            +-----+-----+
            | AudioFile |
            +-----------+

### Access

Currently it can be assumed that each episode only has one audio attachment. For convenience, this is a dedicated association called `:enclosure`. You can preload it with `Repo.preload(episode, :enclosure)`.

### Upload

Use `Radiator.Media.AudioFileUpload` to upload audio files. It is meant for controllers as it takes a `Plug.Upload` struct, but that can be constructed manually as well if required.

```elixir
upload = %Plug.Upload{
  content_type: "audio/mpeg",
  filename: "ls013-ultraschall.mp3",
  path: "/tmp/ls013-ultraschall.mp3"
}
{:ok, audio_file} = Radiator.Media.AudioFileUpload.upload(upload, episode)
```

See `Radiator.Media.AudioFileUpload.upload/2` for details.

## Cover Images & User Avatars

Images are referenced in the schemas they are used as they are 1:1 relationships.

They are:

- `Radiator.Auth.User` field `:avatar`
- `Radiator.Directory.Network` field `:image`
- `Radiator.Directory.Podcast` field `:image`
- `Radiator.Directory.Episode` field `:image`

### Access

Available versions are `:original` and `:thumbnail` (256x256).

```elixir
alias Radiator.Media.PodcastImage

# get podcast image URL
PodcastImage.url({podcast.image, podcast})

# get podcast image thumbnail URL
PodcastImage.url({podcast.image, podcast}, :thumbnail)
```

### Upload

Via schema/arc_ecto:

```elixir
podcast
|> Podcast.changeset(%{
  image: %Plug.Upload{path: "/tmp/image.jpg", filename: "image.jpg"}
})
|> Repo.update
```

## GraphQL

Send POST request with content type `multipart/form-data`. Using curl, `-F` is key.

### Example: Upload episode audio with curl

```bash
curl -X POST -F query='mutation { uploadEpisodeAudio(episode_id: 1, audio: "myupload") {mimeType byteLength title } }'  -F myupload=@test/fixtures/pling.mp3 localhost:4000/api/graphql
# {
#   "data": {
#     "uploadEpisodeAudio": {
#       "title": "pling.mp3",
#       "mimeType": "application/octet-stream",
#       "byteLength": 8476
#     }
#   }
# }
```

### Example: Upload network image with curl

```bash
curl -X POST -F query='mutation { updateNetwork(id: 1, network: {title: "updated title", image: "myupload"}) { id title image }}'  -F myupload=@test/fixtures/image.jpg localhost:4000/api/graphql
# {
#   "data": {
#     "updateNetwork": {
#       "title": "updated title",
#       "image": "http://localhost:9000/radiator/network/1/cover_original.jpg?v=63723926016",
#       "id": "1"
#     }
#   }
# }
```

Setting the image for podcasts and episodes works in the same way.
