This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input

### JS and CSS guidelines

- **Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules** to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.
- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js** and uses a new import syntax in `app.css`:

      @import "tailwindcss" source(none);
      @source "../css";
      @source "../js";
      @source "../../lib/my_app_web";

- **Always use and maintain this import syntax** in the app.css file for projects generated with `phx.new`
- **Never** use `@apply` when writing raw css
- **Always** manually write your own tailwind-based components instead of using daisyUI for a unique, world-class design
- Out of the box **only the app.js and app.css bundles are supported**
  - You cannot reference an external vendor'd script `src` or link `href` in the layouts
  - You must import the vendor deps into app.js and app.css to use them
  - **Never write inline <script>custom js</script> tags within templates**

### UI/UX & design guidelines

- **Produce world-class UI designs** with a focus on usability, aesthetics, and modern design principles
- Implement **subtle micro-interactions** (e.g., button hover effects, and smooth transitions)
- Ensure **clean typography, spacing, and layout balance** for a refined, premium look
- Focus on **delightful details** like hover effects, loading states, and smooth page transitions

## usage_rules usage
_A config-driven dev tool for Elixir projects to manage AGENTS.md files and agent skills from dependencies_

## Using Usage Rules

Many packages have usage rules, which you should *thoroughly* consult before taking any
action. These usage rules contain guidelines and rules *directly from the package authors*.
They are your best source of knowledge for making decisions.

## Modules & functions in the current app and dependencies

When looking for docs for modules & functions that are dependencies of the current project,
or for Elixir itself, use `mix usage_rules.docs`

```
# Search a whole module
mix usage_rules.docs Enum

# Search a specific function
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip

# Search a specific function & arity
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip/1
```


## Searching Documentation

You should also consult the documentation of any tools you are using, early and often. The best 
way to accomplish this is to use the `usage_rules.search_docs` mix task. Once you have
found what you are looking for, use the links in the search results to get more detail. For example:

```
# Search docs for all packages in the current application, including Elixir
mix usage_rules.search_docs Enum.zip

# Search docs for specific packages
mix usage_rules.search_docs Req.get -p req

# Search docs for multi-word queries
mix usage_rules.search_docs "making requests" -p req

# Search only in titles (useful for finding specific functions/modules)
mix usage_rules.search_docs "Enum.zip" --query-by title
```

# Elixir Core Usage Rules

## Pattern Matching
- Use pattern matching over conditional logic when possible
- Prefer to match on function heads instead of using `if`/`else` or `case` in function bodies
- `%{}` matches ANY map, not just empty maps. Use `map_size(map) == 0` guard to check for truly empty maps

## Error Handling
- Use `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` tuples for operations that can fail
- Avoid raising exceptions for control flow
- Use `with` for chaining operations that return `{:ok, _}` or `{:error, _}`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Elixir has no `return` statement, nor early returns. The last expression in a block is always returned.
- Don't use `Enum` functions on large collections when `Stream` is more appropriate
- Avoid nested `case` statements - refactor to a single `case`, `with` or separate functions
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Lists and enumerables cannot be indexed with brackets. Use pattern matching or `Enum` functions
- Prefer `Enum` functions like `Enum.reduce` over recursion
- When recursion is necessary, prefer to use pattern matching in function heads for base case detection
- Using the process dictionary is typically a sign of unidiomatic code
- Only use macros if explicitly requested
- There are many useful standard library functions, prefer to use them where possible

## Function Design
- Use guard clauses: `when is_binary(name) and byte_size(name) > 0`
- Prefer multiple function clauses over complex conditional logic
- Name functions descriptively: `calculate_total_price/2` not `calc/2`
- Predicate function names should not start with `is` and should end in a question mark.
- Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards

## Data Structures
- Use structs over maps when the shape is known: `defstruct [:name, :age]`
- Prefer keyword lists for options: `[timeout: 5000, retries: 3]`
- Use maps for dynamic key-value data
- Prefer to prepend to lists `[new | list]` not `list ++ [new]`

## Mix Tasks

- Use `mix help` to list available mix tasks
- Use `mix help task_name` to get docs for an individual task
- Read the docs and options fully before using tasks

## Testing
- Run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` and a specific test with the line number `mix test path/to/test.exs:123`
- Limit the number of failed tests with `mix test --max-failures n`
- Use `@tag` to tag specific tests, and `mix test --only tag` to run only those tests
- Use `assert_raise` for testing expected exceptions: `assert_raise ArgumentError, fn -> invalid_function() end`
- Use `mix help test` to for full documentation on running tests

## Debugging

- Use `dbg/1` to print values while debugging. This will display the formatted value and other relevant information in the console.

# OTP Usage Rules

## GenServer Best Practices
- Keep state simple and serializable
- Handle all expected messages explicitly
- Use `handle_continue/2` for post-init work
- Implement proper cleanup in `terminate/2` when necessary

## Process Communication
- Use `GenServer.call/3` for synchronous requests expecting replies
- Use `GenServer.cast/2` for fire-and-forget messages.
- When in doubt, use `call` over `cast`, to ensure back-pressure
- Set appropriate timeouts for `call/3` operations

## Fault Tolerance
- Set up processes such that they can handle crashing and being restarted by supervisors
- Use `:max_restarts` and `:max_seconds` to prevent restart loops

## Task and Async
- Use `Task.Supervisor` for better fault tolerance
- Handle task failures with `Task.yield/2` or `Task.shutdown/2`
- Set appropriate task timeouts
- Use `Task.async_stream/3` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure
